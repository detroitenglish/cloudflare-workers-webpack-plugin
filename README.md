# Configuration

## Required Configuration

### Cloudflare Credentials

* `$CLOUDFLARE_AUTH_EMAIL`: Your Cloudflare user email.
* `$CLOUDFLARE_AUTH_KEY`: Your Cloudflare super-duper-secret API key.

### Cloudflare Zone

You **must** provide one of the following two options:

* `zone`: Zone ID of the domain for which you're deploying your script

  **OR**

* `site`: Fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) of your target deployment zone.

**Note**: If both `zone` and `site` are provided, `zone` wins.

## Options

* `pattern`: a route matching pattern, a comma-separated list of patterns, an Array of patterns or an Array of Object to enable (or disable) for your newly spawned JavaScript minion (default: `undefined`). Unless `enabled` is specified, it's assumed to be `enabled`
  - Example (string): `"*.your-site.lol"`
  - Example (list): `"*.your-site.lol,your-site.lol/some-pattern/*"`
  - Example (string Array): `["*.your-site.lol", "your-site.lol/some-pattern/*"]`
  - Example (Object Array): `[{ pattern: "*.your-site.lol", enabled: true }, { pattern: "some-pattern.your-site.lol", enabled: false }]`
* `script`: **relative** path to your worker script (default: `<webpack-config-output-file>`)
* `metadataPath`: Optional **relative** path to a [JSON metadata file with e.g. secrets](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/api/resource-bindings/secrets-vault/) (default: `undefined`)
* `clearRoutes`: Delete ALL existing route patterns; requires a `pattern` string be provided (default: `false`)
* `skipWorkerUpload`: Skip uploading the worker script and process only route patterns (default: `false`)
* `reset`: Delete ALL route patterns, DELETE existing worker script, and exit (default: `false`)
* `verbose`: Log additional information about each deployment step to the console (default: `false`)
* `colors`: Use colors in console output (default: `false`)
* `emoji`: Use emoji in console output (default: `false`)
* `enabled`: Whether to deploy to Cloudflare or bypass; useful for e.g. CI and testing (default: `true`)

**Note**: If you provide 1 or more matching patterns, any currently enabled matching patterns will be disabled if they are not included in the `pattern` option.
